# My Flutter UI challengs

Hello, my name is Antonio Pedro, I am a software developer and I specializeed in mobile development with flutter and Android with over 5 years of experience. In this repository, you will find some UI challenges, they are nothing but UI prototypes that I found on Dribble, Behance and etc, and I translate into real UI using flutter. I hope you enjoy.

This one I found on Instagram (UI gradient). I took only the inspiration.
